For the past few months, I've had a confusing time not even knowing what I want to do vaguely. CS is such a broad field; there are endless things where Computer Science is applied. Then, what should I do?

**I just decided to make a special major called "Art & Technology" and double-major in it. ðŸ¥³**

So I'll be a Computer Science and Art & Technology double major! I've wanted to double major in a different field instead of choosing a track in CS, which is a thing that exists at other (big) schools.

Here's why I think I'll do Art + Tech:

I've always been interested in issues about tech and accessibility, such as digital divide across generations and digital literacy. Without the improvement of accessibility, the advancement of technology is useless in my opinion.

So, I've even thought about doing UX/UI design but I want to do a more technical part as I want to have a job that involves coding. UX/UI *engineering* might be it.

Then, I thought Art (including music and visual art) is what breaks down the barrier of cultural and generational differences, and thus connects everyone and anyone. That's why I thought, "I want to combine art and tech!"

I don't know, I might change my mind. But I just wanted to jot down my initial thoughts as to why I want to do art and tech.

This piece is not really an essay. It's just a quick glance on my mind. So I added a new category, "Blog!"

Thanks for reading!
