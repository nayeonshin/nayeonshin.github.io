![Nayeon's Self-Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\nayeon-intro.png)

# Hello, World!

Thank you for visiting my blog. My name is Nayeon Shin. Nayeon is pronounced nah-yeon. I'm from South Korea, and I'm a sophomore at Mount Holyoke College studying Computer Science.

This blog is my journal of being a student developer, writer, and human. I often think that it would have been great if I kept writing a journal till now after my elementary school teachers forced me to do as homework. Now that I have a new life goal to become a developer, I realized it's the right time for me to start again. It's neither too early nor late. It's the perfect timing and I'm grateful that I know it now.

People do not often know if they are making a progress even when they actually are. I'm not an exception. I have doubts about myself. Every day, I question if I'm doing well, if what I'm doing is right, and if I'm not hardworking enough. But I know I will continue doing whatever I want to pursue, no matter how not good I think I am.

Therefore, I will write and write and write to visualize my daily improvements and accomplishments â€” to show myself that I'm getting better; to remind myself that I did well enough today; and to have the one and only journal of mine in the world that reflects the life of a person named Nayeon Shin.

Lastly, many thanks to one of my lifelong mentors, SJ, who motivated me to start this GitHub blog. You're deeply admired by me.
