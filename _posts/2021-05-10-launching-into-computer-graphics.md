# Motivation

Since I took a gap year, I decided that one of my main goals during my gap year would be finding out where my passion lies. I know that I enjoy coding and have declared a major in Computer Science. But I don't know the subfield of CS that I'd like to specialize in. For the past few weeks, I have been obsessed with short clips of Despicable Me series on YouTube. I think I have watched all the movies like twice or three times, but I still watch the same videos again and again because I just love Minions so much. Then, I started thinking, maybe I might want to do Computer Graphics. Who knows? But I'm a total noob when it comes to the areas like Computer Graphics.

So where should I start? You know, when we try to start something completely new, we often don't even know where to start. We don't even know how much we don't know! Then, I found this video on Youtube: [Beginners Guide to Learning 3D Computer Graphics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT5oZndzj68&t=333s). This post will be the summary of what's introduced in the video and what I've learned from it (mostly just transcription).

# 1. Where should I start?

Fields:

- Animated Movies
- VR
- Architectural Visualization ("Archivis")
- VFX
- Gaming
- 3D Printing

Regardless of what field you want to specialize in, a basic understanding of 3D is necessary for all of these. And what you learn in one field can often be transferred to another.

## 1.1. Learn the Basics of 3D

A.k.a. 3 building blocks of 3D:

1. Modelling
2. Texturing
3. Lighting

# 2. What software should I use?

- Cinema 4D
- 3ds Max
- Maya
- Zbrush
- Houdini
- Lightwave
- Blender

There's not really an industry standard. Studios today typically use a range of different software for different things. Some studios like Pixar use their own in-house software that isn't even available to the public (interesting!).

But the good news is that if a studio likes your work, it doesn't matter what software you use. Art is their number one priority.

Priorities for choosing software:

1. Inexpensive
2. Functional
3. Easy to learn

â†’ Recommended to start with Blender

Reasons:

1. Blender is the only one (among the options in the list) which is 100% free.
2. Many great features: Open Movies
3. Community

# Conclusion

Learn Blender.

Thanks for reading! I'll come back with another post.
