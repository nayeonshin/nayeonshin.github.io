Annyeong, everyone. I'm Nayeon. ("Annyeong" means "Hi" in Korean.) If you're a female underclassman in college pursuing Computer Science and looking for a summer internship, [Girls Who Code's Virtual Summer Immersion Program Teaching Assistant](https://girlswhocode.com/programs/summer-immersion-program) is an exciting opportunity. Long story short, I was able to pass every step and get the offer to join GWC for summer 2021 in March or so but I had to turn it down for personal reasons. In this post, I'm going to explain how I could get the offer, what my experience with the recruiting process was like, and how I got the interviewer telling me my teaching skills are "phenomenal" in the middle of the interview. Are you curious about how I prepared and what I actually did during the interview? Let's get into it!

There are two steps.

# Step 1: Apply online

Then, you'll see the application page. Fill out and answer everything carefully. Make sure you do not have any errors or mistakes in the information you provide.

![Girls Who Code application questions]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/2021-05-09-girls-who-code-application-questions.png)

On the application, you will see 3 questions you're required to answer.

It says your answer shouldn't be longer than 350 questions in length. I wanted to do really well on these so I pulled up Microsoft Word to type my answers instead of typing directly into the answer boxes. I actually thought about sharing what I wrote but I'm reluctant to do so as it's quite personal. Instead, I'll give you some tips:

**First and foremost, be honest.**

Like, literally. I know this is so cliche. But really. Do not exaggerate or overstate at all. Write what's on your mind and what you actually have experienced. Even if you lie and pass this step, your interviewer will know that you have lied. Remember that the people who interview students for this position are *professional*.

Let's dissect each question and think about how to write great answers.

1. Why do you want to work with Girls Who Code? Why do you want to teach in the Virtual Summer Immersion Program specifically?

   Two questions.

   - Why do you want to work with Girls Who Code?
   - Why do you want to teach in the Virtual Summer Program specifically?

   It'd be great if you first read the [Girls Who Code's mission](https://girlswhocode.com/about-us) and think about how you can weave it into your answers. (Also read [their inclusion statement](https://girlswhocode.com/diversity-equity-and-inclusion)). In short, Girls Who Code has the mission of bridging the gender gap in tech. Tech is still a male-dominated area; it's easy to get discouraged to start Computer Science if you're one of the few female students in your CS class. So, how should you tackle these questions now that you know their mission?

   - Think about how you got interested in Computer Science.

   Was it a supportive and encouraging high school teacher (or professor)? Was it watching an inspirational speech of a female tech CEO? Was it just that you found your interest in coding (though CS is not all about coding)?

   For me, I first went to a co-ed liberal arts college. I took Introduction to Computer Science there in my first year, and I was surprised to see there were only like 5 female students out of about 20 classmates. Although it was a small class, the population of female students taking it was still disproportionately small. I felt a bit discouraged, actually.

   Then I transferred to my current college as a sophomore, which is a women's college where a lot of students major or minor in Computer Science or Data Science. I took Data Structures in the first semester and loved how supportive my instructors were. For me, I personally did not do well in the intro to CS class, so I struggled a lot more in the class. But I just kept pushing myself and tried to understand what was going on in the class. I got super discouraged and overwhelmed throughout the course, but I could learn a lot and successfully complete it. Ironically, I got an A on Introduction to Computer Science but an A- on Data Structures, although I said I learned a lot in Data Structures. That was when I was reminded again that grades sometimes fail to capture how much and well you have learned.

   I wrote about my experience of taking CS classes at a co-ed college and a women's college, respectively, and talked about how it was different. Then, I mentioned the importance of encouraging instructors to get more girls involved in tech. My answer is mostly about why it's important to empower girls and women in tech along with the explanation of my classroom experience. Lastly, I mentioned that I'd want to deliver the support I got from the instructors to the girls at Girls Who Code.

2. Which of our core values do you believe is most important to your role as a teacher in the virtual Summer Immersion Program? Why? You can find our core values on our website.

   [This](https://girlswhocode.com/about-us) is the page that explains their core values: Bravery, Sisterhood, and Activism. As you know, there is no one right answer. As long as you make the link clear between the value of your choice and your role as a teacher, you should be fine. For me, I didn't refer to that website but saw a post about it, which had some different contents. On the website, there are only 3 values, but on the post I saw (it was the official post from GWC), it showed me that their core values are Girls First Leadership, Candor, Sisterhood, Quality, and Bravery. I'm not sure which post you should refer to, but I personally chose Candor.

   I decided to share my answer to this question. It's a lot less personal than what I wrote for Q1, but please do not plagiarize:

   > It is candor. I believe the only difference between other girls who haven't learned coding and me is just that I have learned it before they have. People may think teachers are smarter than students. Indeed, they have more knowledge and experience. However, we are all lifelong learners, even if you're in a position to teach other people. There can be embarrassing times for me: I get asked a question I don't know the answer to, need to ask for help from other teachers or even students, or misunderstand what someone has said. It is my responsibility as a teacher and learner to be candid and patient in such situations.
   >
   > Candor is the core of learning; it's much more critical now as we are all going through a hard time. Admitting what I don't know, asking questions, and acknowledging my mistakes will take vulnerability and honesty, especially with the title of a mentor and teacher in the program. But it's what I will have to face and keep doing. It would also help students become open-minded and honest when they recognize that I'm doing that. If everyone in class puts themselves in each other's shoes, tries to be patient with one another, and holds oneself accountable, that's when I would think to myself that I'm doing well as a teacher.

   It's probably not the best answer ever but I hope you could sense that I was trying to be as honest as possible in my answer. Again, please do not copy the bits and pieces of my answer; please just read it to get a sense of what you would need to talk about.

   One tip I'd give you is to first explicitly write which core value you have chosen. My answer starts with "It is candor." Make it clear which is the value of your choice before you expand your answer.

3. What does an inclusive and supportive virtual classroom environment look like to you? What is the teacher doing and saying? What are students doing and saying?

   I was honestly running out of ideas after having finished writing my answers for the two other questions. But the way I answered this is that I wrote what I think is an "inclusive and supportive virtual classroom environment" is from the beginning till the end. I focused on a few things:

   - Everyone gets the chance to speak.
   - Students are the ones who lead class discussions.
   - Ice breakers
   - Checking in on how everyone is doing in class

   Again, there is no right answer. What you think is right would be the right answer. Feel free to be creative and think outside the box as much as you can!

# Step 2: Interview

Once you pass the first step, you will be reached out by an email. You'll be asked to select the interview time and given a project info sheet you can use to prepare. The interview is on Google Meet. If you haven't tried the platform, make sure you sign into your Google account and open a meeting room there to see if you have any technical problems.
