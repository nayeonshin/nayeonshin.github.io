I haven't posted for a while. I thought I should post something (especially anything technical I learned that day) the other day, but it's really hard to keep doing so. I'm not very disciplined........

Here are some life updates:

- It's not that I felt too lazy to write a post. Writing a blog post is one of my top priorities. But I just didn't feel like writing one, as there were some bad things going on in my life.
- I just have a lot of work. I hope I can survive until I return to school.
- I think working remotely is really hard... It's not just about the time difference and exhaustion from online meetings. Every time I make careless mistakes or miscommunicate, I feel really, really bad.
- Am I doing okay?
