![Nayeon's Self-Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}\assets\images\nayeon-intro.png)

# Hello, World!

Thank you for visiting my blog. My name is Nayeon Shin. Nayeon is pronounced nah-yeon. I'm from South Korea, and I'm a sophomore at Mount Holyoke College studying Computer Science and Art & Technology (Special major).

This blog is my journal of being a student developer (more like an aspiring developer), writer, and human. I often think that it would have been great if I kept writing a journal till now after my elementary school teachers forced me to do as homework. Now that I have a new life goal to become some kind of a developer, I realized it's the right time for me to start writing about my life again.

The world is full of smart, outstanding, creative, and talented people. If I look around, I notice that even the people sitting next to me in the classroom look so much smarter and more talented than me. It sometimes makes me wonder "Will I ever be able to reach that level in my life?" in self-doubt and regret that I didn't work harder in the past. Every day, I question if I'm doing well, if what I'm doing is right, and if I'm not hardworking enough.

Therefore, I will write and write and write to visualize my daily improvements and accomplishments that come with failures and trials and errors â€” to show myself that I'm getting better; to remind myself that I did well enough today; and to have the one and only journal of mine that reflects the life of a person named Nayeon Shin. I'm also trying to write a [TIL (Today I learned)](https://github.com/nayeonshin/til) every day.

Lastly, many thanks to one of my lifelong mentors, SJ, who motivated me to start this GitHub blog. You're deeply admired by me.
