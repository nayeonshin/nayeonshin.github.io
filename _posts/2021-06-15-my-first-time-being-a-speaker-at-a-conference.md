## So... I spoke at a conference

Jeez... It still doesn't feel real. [I just attended a conference for the first time about a month ago]({{ site.baseurl }}writing/my-first-pycon/), but now I'm someone who has spoken at a conference.

How it all happened:

It was just a coincidence. I'm an active volunteer at Women Who Code Python Track. I was planning to present the two sessions about heaps and graphs, continuing the "Intro to Data Structures with Python" series. All the sessions in the series start at 9 am on Fridays Korea Standard Time. But the other week, the track people asked if I'd be willing to lead my heaps session at [WWCode CONNECT REIMAGINE 2021](https://connectreimagine.womenwhocode.dev/).

CONNECT (a.k.a. "CONNECT REIMAGINE," "WWCode CONNECT," etc.) is an annual inclusive developer conference hosted by Women Who Code. Just like most conferences, CONNECT 2021 happened online. Following the schedule of the series, my original session was scheduled to start at 9 am on Friday, June 11, 2021 Korea Standard Time. But it was when CONNECT would be taking place as well. Because the times overlapped, the Python Track people suggested that I deliver the session at CONNECT. They said it could be either a workshop or a session at the Python booth. I hesitated a bit, thinking I wasn't professional enough to speak at a formal conference. Then, I was like, "Score."

This is how the "Intro to Data Structures with Python: Heaps" started.

## Preparation

I needed to brush up on my rusty heaps knowledge. I just utilized the resources I used in my Data Structures series: my professor's slides, the textbook, and a few other resources. I thought it would take hours just making the slides for the workshop, since I struggled with heaps so much when learning about them for the first time.

### Agenda

1. Queues & Trees Review
2. Priority Queue
3. Heap
   1. Binary Heap
   2. Structure Property
   3. Order Property
   4. Heap Operations
   5. Implementation
4. Q&A
5. Live Coding
6. Resources

Since the concepts of priority queues and heaps are pretty much based on queues and trees, I thought it would be useful to include a Queues & Trees review.
