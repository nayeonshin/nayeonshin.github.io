**Trigger warning: verbal/online harassment, a few censored bad words**

At the end of April 2021, I experienced a disgusting and terrifying incident that I will never ever be able to forget for the rest of my life. A man around my father's age who found me through a TA program sent me a super long, disturbing LinkedIn message that he was "in love with" me. (I really hope using the past tense verb, "was," is correct and it's not an ongoing thing.) He approached me on LinkedIn saying he'd like to connect as he and I (I didn't even want to say "we") were in the same program. And I connected without thinking much. Since then, he started messaging me every single day. (If you're that man and you're reading this, GTFO. Like seriously, I kindly ask you to f**k off.) I never cuss (especially publicly) but this time, I can't stand. I'm going to censor bad words by using abbreviations and replacing vowels, though.

He sounded nice and friendly at first. He even sent me a photo of his cat (I'm not really a cat person honestly, though), which I kind of appreciated. He kept sending me messages, and I felt like I needed to keep replying. I only talked to him on LinkedIn for like two days. (I'm 100% sure it was not more than 4 days.) Does he know what I look like? Unfortunately, yes. It's because people who are in my connections can see my profile picture, and he was my connection at first. Have I even seen him in a meeting? No. Do I even know what he sounds like? NO. The topics of conversations? They were just how much I enjoy coding in Python and some Korean celebrities that I like, such as IU.

Then, it happened. I woke up early in that morning. Then I casually checked my phone and saw I got new messages on LinkedIn. As soon as I started reading them, I started shaking and almost burst into tears.

What did he send me? It was just a ton of ridiculous message that he felt I was "in love with" him. The reason he thought that way? I just pressed a heart emoji on one of his messages. I do that when I have nothing else to say, in appreciation of the other person who chatted with me. I understand that it might not look normal for some people, especially who are much older. But he said he tried to "interpret" that heart emoji. And remember, he's just as old as my father. He freaking went to a graduate school even before I was born. (fyi, I just turned twenty. üòï) He's even in a professional position at a pretty reputable company, and I have no idea what his company is doing to train their employees.

I was breaking down for the next days. I was only in my room, kept the lights off, and was crying as much as I could. I regretted accepting his connection request in the first place. I regretted so freaking much replying to his messages. This is so traumatizing, especially since it's not my first time being inappropriately approached by a much much much older man. I still feel so unsafe and disgusted by what I experienced. Some other things happened, but I won't mention them as well. The only thing I could do to protect myself was to block him and report the messages I got. But funny, what LinkedIn told me about my report? They said the message was not against their rules or something. They said "We understand that this message was not what you wanted to see" but didn't take any action.

Understanding involves empathy, if you can't empathize with me and don't take action, you freaking don't understand. I'm so disappointed by how LinkedIn reacts to such incidents. If LinkedIn had nothing to do with my career, I would not use it at all. Why would I connect with some total strangers online? I never use any online dating apps, sites, or whatsoever.

Why do some people think LinkedIn is a dating site or something? If you want to find a partner online, go to freaking Tinder or something. LinkedIn connections are not like Tinder matches. I remember that I once saw a woman's post on LinkedIn that LinkedIn is not a dating website. And I was like, "Isn't that obvious?" and shrugged it off. But then now that I have experienced this, I know there are unfortunately some humans on LinkedIn who reach out to women just for their own pleasure.

Please, please, please, please, please do not ever compliment the looks of women on LinkedIn you don't know in person (Unfortunately, I met a man who complimented my appearance at an online conference. Surprise surprise. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), not to mention that you should NOT send "I'm in love with you" kind of messages there. I really beg you. If you're human, please just don't.
